# ACE-Neurologicql

This repository contains materials for the "Enhanced ACEs Impact on Brain Development Assessment" interface.

The repository is organized into communication **channels** to clarify the role of each component:

- `channels/system`: resources that represent the main interface or system components.
- `channels/user`: space for user-supplied data or resources.
- `channels/assistant`: a dedicated area for notes or resources used by the assistant (ChatGPT).

Place relevant files or documentation within these folders to keep each channel distinct. The existing `ace.html` file represents the system interface and remains at the project root.
